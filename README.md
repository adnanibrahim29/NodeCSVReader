# Employee Data Api

This is a simple CSV reader and CRUD Api with Node.js

The Goal was to implement an Get Request and test using Postman 

I extracted the data using 'csv-parser' and pushed the data into an array.

I used express to perform the get request and handled an error situation using a 400 request. 

I am printing out the results as JSON data.

When downloaded the folder install run 'npm install' to install all dependencies

I had to use port 3000 which was an available port. 

Port 5000 was not available. 

# To Test on Postman
 Use Get http://localhost:3000/employees

you will get the data in JSON format.

# To exit 

press control c to exit
